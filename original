Dear Mr. Hu
There was an event tonight "Home party". Recently, a leader came from Shanghai who was mainly to inspect our work. Our department organized a "Home Party" in this evening. I went to the party after work. Of course, the first thing is to eat hot pot, There are many vegetables but no meat dishes. This is because the leader is a buddhist. There are many recreational activities here, such as karaoke、desktop、football、billiards、mahjong、besides, there are six game machine there. This is my first time to attend the party in my life. I searched baidu course, This word comes from the English pronunciation in Chinese, What it really means is a private family gathering.
