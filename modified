Dear Mr. Hu
There was an event tonight "Home party" .Recently,Our company camed a leader from Shanghai which mainly inspected our work. So the department organized a "Home Party"  in this evening. I went to the party after work. Of course, the first is to eat hot pot,There are many vegetables,but no meat dishes. This is because The leader is a buddhist.There are many recreational activities here,such as karaoke，desktop football、billiards、mahjong、besides had six game  machine. This is my first time to attended in my life. I searched baidu course,This word comes from the English pronunciation in Chinese, What it really means is a private family togathering.
